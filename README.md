# Feedback Auto Fill

I created this extension for filling the feedback form with single click, because I am lazy :)

The filler data is taken from this [repo](https://github.com/grapheo12/erp_feedback).

Icons are taken from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/premium-icon/feedback_2546749?term=feedback&page=1&position=14&page=1&position=14&related_id=2546749&origin=tag)

## Usage

Open the feedback page and click on the fill feedback button. There is also another variant which provides random generated feedback strings (Highly recommended).
